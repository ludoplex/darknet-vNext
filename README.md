# THE LAST COMMIT, ALL THE BEST FOR YOU!

Project Status: Freeze!

From now on, I will not push anymore my commits to this repository, however, I will be open to your pull requests to approve those and increase the contributors' list, enjoy! ;-). I think OpenCL and this CUDA version has a bright future, I am leaving some open issues, and I hope community will be able to solve them if needed. Thank you! ;-).
